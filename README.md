# Python Basics – Day 5 (Conditional Statements)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my **Day 5 Python practice work**, focused on learning **conditional statements** in Python.  
The goal of this day was to understand how programs make **decisions** based on conditions.


## 📚 Topics Covered
- if statement  
- if–else statement  
- if–elif–else ladder  
- Comparison operators  
- Logical operators  


## 📝 Tasks Completed

### 1️⃣ Adult or Minor Check
- Takes age as input  
- Prints **Adult** if age is 18 or above  
- Prints **Minor** otherwise  


### 2️⃣ Positive, Negative, or Zero
- Takes a number as input  
- Checks whether the number is:
  - Positive  
  - Negative  
  - Zero  

---

### 3️⃣ Greatest of Two Numbers
- Takes two numbers as input  
- Prints the greater number  
- Prints **Both are equal** if values are the same  


### 4️⃣ Simple Grade System
- Takes marks as input  
- Prints grade based on marks:
  - 90 and above → A  
  - 80–89 → B  
  - 70–79 → C  
  - Below 70 → Fail
